# fastai_audio testing

Test project for  audio handling in the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library. Forked from the great work of https://github.com/zcaceres/fastai-audio. Also borrowing from the similarly great work of https://github.com/mogwai/fastai_audio (in fact unless you have a specific reason you should probably use this instead as this library isn't really intended for public use).
